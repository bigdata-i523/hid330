        Big data and its applications in providing best service outcome to
        the patients is a new trend.  Patient care is the main objective of healthcare
        organizations. Getting best possible care in  terms of costs and service outcome
        are patients'' expectations.

        With increasing use of sensors and smart devices or internet of things that generate
        real time data and opt for immediate output, immediate message delivery and reliable result
        is a must. This requires reliable efficient connection among sensors and near end devices.
        MQTT protocol  establishes the connection among participating clients. Traditionally connected
        devices and industrial automation equipment are  connected to cloud. Data flow between cloud
        services and internet of things may not be reliable and efficient all the time.
        With growing number of smart devices, internet of things and their applications, communications
        between them and cloud services need reliable internet connection with no data limitations.
        Edge computing, data flow between near end devices, under MQTT can be a solution to improve
        latency of data flow,  better scalability and taking load off on local servers.

        Outdoor air pollution is one of the risk factors of public health. Air pollution adds burden to public
        health. Both developing and developed world use new technology and expertise to monitor outdoor air quality.
        United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) collects outdoor air quality data from state, local
        and tribal agencies through outdoor air quality monitors across the country. The data get collected into
        the Air Quality System (AQS) database. This data can be used for variety of purposes such as education,
        research and regulatory. Data from this data--mart is available for different time--series like hourly,
        daily, weekly, monthly and yearly. It gives us a real picture of outdoor air quality and measurements of
        pollutants present in the air in a particular time period. The data can be used for comparing air quality
        among different regions, raise awareness to general public so that they can play a role in reducing household
        air pollutants, to see the trend of air pollutants at different time periods in a day or a season, it can also
        be combined with emissions data for comparative study. Data analysis of pollutants help identify pollution hot
        spots. Since air quality is vital for public health and environmental health, air quality monitoring possesses
        great significance from public health perspective. It is worth looking at simple statistical values and level of
        air quality index value for the pollutants described as criteria pollutants as described by World Health
        Organization. Simple statistical calculations in bigger datasets help understand the extent and source of problem.
        It helps in comparing past statistics with the present so helps in evaluations of action being taken during past
        periods. Looking at the overall mean value of criteria pollutants of 2016 and 2006 reveals improved air quality
        level to some extent for all core-based statistical areas. But the mean value of carbon monoxide has significantly
        increased over the ten years period.
