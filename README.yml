        With increasing use of sensors and smart devices or internet of things that generate
        real time data and opt for immediate output, immediate message delivery and reliable result
        is a must. This requires reliable efficient connection among sensors and near end devices.
        MQTT protocol  establishes the connection among participating clients. Traditionally connected
        devices and industrial automation equipment are  connected to cloud. Data flow between cloud
        services and internet of things may not be reliable and efficient all the time.
        With growing number of smart devices, internet of things and their applications, communications
        between them and cloud services need reliable internet connection with no data limitations.
        Edge computing, data flow between near end devices, under MQTT can be a solution to improve
        latency of data flow,  better scalability and taking load off on local servers.
